### Competition data

Note that the competition data is not included in the archive. It *has to be copied in* in order to reproduce the solution.

Copy the data into the

```
nasa_rwanda_field_boundary_competition
```

directory. This directory is in the archive, but it is just an empty placeholder initially.

When done, it should look something like this.

```

## Data Preparation
For simplicity, the data in ```nasa_rwanda_field_boundary_competition``` was converted to ```pkl``` format using 
```
Saving Images as pkl.ipynb
```
When done, it should look something like this.
```

## Solution review

The solution is based on the following pre-trained models
 - encoders
   - selecsls42b
   - selecsls60
   - sebotnet33ts_256
   - vgg13_bn
   - vgg19
   - vgg16
   - vgg19_bn
 - decoders
   - unet++
   - manet
   - [MANet](https://github.com/bojesomo/model_nasa_rwanda_field_boundary_competition_silver/tree/main/full_solution/decoders/MANet.py)
   - [fapn](https://github.com/bojesomo/model_nasa_rwanda_field_boundary_competition_silver/tree/main/full_solution/decoders/fapn.py)

The following variations were applied to this model. It was majorly trained with varied set of input channels and output types
 - input variation
   - visible only
     - band 1 (Blue)
     - band 2 (Green)
     - band 3 (Red)
   - all bands available
     - band 1 (Blue)
     - band 2 (Green)
     - band 3 (Red)
     - band 4 (NIR)
     
 - output variation
  - boundary only
  - boundary + extent
    - `extent` refers to filling all fields with 1 to mimic a pure segmentation mask 

### System

These models were optimised using.

 - Linux
 - 16GB NVIDIA GPU

It will take a few hours to run.

## Preprocessing

All channels were scaled using statistics computed from the training data.

## Validation

All models were trained with full data without validation using `sam` optimizer with `adamw` as the `base optimizer` to limit overfitting.

## Postprocessing
TTA
 - merge
   - max
 - ops
   - `HorizontalFlip`
   - `VerticalFlip`
   - `Rotate90`

## Running the code

### Model

Once the data is ready, you can run the solution by running the notebook.

```
Experiments.ipynb
```

### Submission

I apply threshold 0.9 then voting ensemble on each cell. The final submission file can be generated by running the notebook

```
ensemble.ipynb
```
