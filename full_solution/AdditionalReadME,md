The code navigation goes as follows

    - For data conversion from raw files to pkl (Saving Images as pkl)
    - structure
        - data_loader : includes dataset and pytorch-lightning Datamodule
        - model : includes the pytorch-lightning model used in this work
        - utils : extra code simplification functions
        - sam : SAM optimizer
        - decoders : include some segmentation decoders not in segmentation-models-pytorch
            - MANet.py
            - fapn.py
        - data/  (created during pkl file creation)
            - train/
                - fields/
                - masks/
            - test/
                - fields/
            - train.csv
            - test.csv
            - statistics.csv
            
    - For running the experiment used in generating the leaderboard submission (Experiments)
        - This experiment was used for creating a list of models (17)
        - The models will be saved in $results$ folder.
        - The experiment also individually create a submission ready csv files for each $model$ used as well as an ensemble based on hard voting.
        - the ensemble (ens_sub.csv) created is the final submission.
                 
                 
 
 Thank you
